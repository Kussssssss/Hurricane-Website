# Hurricane Trajectory Analysis and Prediction Application

## Application Concept

The Hurricane Trajectory Analysis and Prediction application will be an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows users to explore hurricane trajectory data, visualize patterns, and predict hurricane categories based on trajectory features. The application will leverage the Pactus library's hurricane dataset and provide insights through interactive visualizations and machine learning models.
